Bridge Lang: AI-Powered Language Learning and Translation Web App

Bridge Lang is a web application designed to assist users in learning languages of their choice. It also provides translation services for sentences, enabling easy communication across languages. Currently in its testing phase with a small group of users, the app aims to gather valuable feedback and improve the user experience.

Bridge Lang is just the beginning. We have many exciting and impactful applications in development, aimed at supporting farmers and individuals with speech impairments. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to expand our offerings.
